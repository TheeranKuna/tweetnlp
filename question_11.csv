Q11: Do loyalty programs help to retain customers and build a long-term relationship?
"Yes. Loyalty programs provide customers with an incentive to return. Once a relationship is developed, it is likely that they will remain loyal."
"Loyalty programs have been around for years and proven to be very successful especially in the hospitality and airline industry. Giving perks and privileges to loyal customers are ways to attract brand loyalty and long term relationship. However, brands must be creative and innovative to add new incentives in order to stay relevant in the ever growing competitive market."
"By having a point system, or by having member discounts, this will help retain customers, encouraging more customers to become members, and build a long term relationship by continuously gaining points buying goods or items from the brand. "
Depending on the utility and value of the program 
"Loyalty programs need to have tangible benefits that reap benefits in a reasonable time frame. For example, if I have points that are equivalent to a discount or a voucher I am more likely to return to a platform to use them then if I had to accumulate points to reach a certain number before being able to use them. "

"Yes in my opinion, either through cost reduction promotions or increased exposure to the brand"
"Possibly. The Starbucks card is a good example. Though the market is changing and with new brands emerging, consumers don't want to be locked in. "
"Yes, loyalty programs provide incentives for customers to stay loyal. Customers are less likely to look for alternatives if they know they are getting rewards for staying loyal. Especially, if the program rewards increments depending on the loyalty of the customers. "
"Offering significant discounts for the next products are well received, for example Adidas. This would lead to repeated purchases. However, having too many conditions attached to loyalty programme is counter-intuitive and may back-fire."
Yes. It often incentivizes repeat purchases amongst users. This would be enhanced if it includes attractive deals and rewards.
