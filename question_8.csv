Q8: Ethical matters adopted do play and a major rolein customer loyalty and satisfaction. Do you agree with this?
"Yes! Customers are concerned with ethical manufacturing practices, environmental impact, personal data
and other ethical issues. Maintaining these ethics and being transparent can be a pillar of a loyal customer base"
Definitely agree that ethical matters adopted by Brand do play a major role in maintaining customer's loyalty. No one would like to be associated with an unethical company.
Yes i do agree with this. 
Yes very much so 
"To some extent depending on the cause being supported. For example I may be willing to pay more for something supporting a social cause, or unwilling to make purchases from a brands known to have practices that oppose my values however may not be loyal to a brand solely because of their ethics. All else equal I would support a brand which supports ethical matters. "
To some extent.  Usually does not matter unless widely known/publicised and very sensitive issues such as racism/sexism
Yes
It depends on the product and the customer. Some customers do not care about ethics
"Depends again. Sure they don't want to buy a bag from a known sweatshop user, but value always does trump ethics. "
"Yes, customers usually move to companies that practice or display good ethical practices, which increases the trust customers have in the company. "
"Ethics though difficult to define clearly, is important. Using my data without my knowledge or tracking my buying preferences with upfront informing customers are not ethical practices. In some instances, banks pass your information to outsourced parties for loan marketing is unpleasant and annoys me.  This is an important aspect of data privacy."
Strongly agree.
