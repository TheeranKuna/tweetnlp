Q2: Ways do tech AI chatbots and predictivve analytics affect Cxpectations & Satisfaction
"AI powered chatbots do not replace human customer service. More often than not, customers want their questions answered by a human being that can understand their issues"
"Innovative technologies must be coupled with cost effectiveness to make it attractive to users. In a competitive market, turnaround respond time and accuracy is critical to business owners. Brand should go beyond customer expectations and satisfaction, must have the ''wow'' factor. Predictive analytics must go beyond prediction. It must include prescriptive analytics too. It should suggest specific actions and outcomes based on data analysis and modeling. There's many AI chatbots in the market but few answers that question ""what should we do?"""
"Due to the immediate response from AI powered chatbots such as chatgpt and gemini ai, customers will now expect such quick response and answers that are tailored to their needs. "
"Predictive analytics and prompts for next best action, Hyper-personalisation, Improved efficiency and productivity, Faster resolution and turnaround time for queries and complains, Seamless integration and experience across the value chain"
When AI powered chatbots are not able to respond to queries and provide incomplete or inaccurate responses instead of escalating to a customer service representative it deters me from using service and results in reduced satisfaction 
Quick answers to frequently asked questions rather than having to wait for humans to reply via email over few days 
"Ease of use and intuitive responses given by the bots. Automatically link to or offer Tel. no. for human clarification, if enquirer responds that answers given are not helpful . Can always inform to call only during office hours it bot answers not helpful"
They are expected to provide solutions to the customers faster and better than a human
"Hyper personalisation, proactiveness, seamless integration across channels. However customers just expect this. They rarely care about the use of AI or other tools to achieve this. "
"AI-powered chatbots improve the efficiency of customer service since customers do not have to wait in que to chat with an agent. The downside is that the chatbot's ability to solve the customers' needs is limited to what it was pretrained with. Essentially, the bot can only solve a limited number of problems, and customers would have to word the problem in a manner that would trigger the required response. While maintaining the traditional method of speaking to an agent would make it easier for customers to communicate their problems. In terms of predictive analytics, for an end-user, the only impact that I noticed is an increase in the number of promotional emails or notifications sent to me about a new product that I recently viewed on the company’s website."
"This is important, as it can track preferences, re-order products example Amazon, bringing to attention similar or items that I may like based on my buying history and preferences. It can help widen the customer to experience newer products by advocating based on my profile/buying history."
"AI-powered chat bots provide round-the-clock customer support, delivering immediate responses regardless of the time zone differences. This enhances the user experience, particularly for customers who expect immediate responses to their queries."
