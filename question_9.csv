Q9: Do Brands openly share their policies and guidelines regarding the use of AI?
"Some do, some do not, due to legal grey areas but i believe that they should"
"In the current environment, I don't see brands share their policies and guidelines regarding the use of AI. There could be some infringement of copyrights and more study needs to be done to address this matter. Ultimately a framework on the use of AI should be written up to protect data and copyright materials from being used illegally or abused."
Some brands do but not fully. 
No..not at the moment but this will change soon as mandatory disclosure requirements are impending 
Yes but I have not in a way that is easy or digestible. I would assume it is somewhere in the terms and conditions which I generally would not read. 
no
Yes and they should 
"Not sure, but it would not matter (see answer #7). It is also commonly hidden behind legalese."
They have it somewhere if and when called upon to reference it. 
"Most of the time, however, it is usually in a long document, which forces customers who are concerned with the policies and guidelines to spend a long time going through the document. "
"To my knowledge, I do not think so. It could be embedded in their terms and conditions that customers skip. I do agree customers must play an active role and ask brands to state specifically their policies and guidelines regarding the use of AI. If it is left to the brands, there would not be improvements in their AI policies and guidelines as well as transparency."
"Big brands often share their policies and guidelines in terms of transparency reports. These reports act as a check and balance, particularly when sensitive data is involved. Additionally, it shows how brand is handling the information responsibility."
