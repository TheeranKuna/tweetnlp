Q7:How much of Brand Perception depends on transparency regarding to personal data handling practices?
"This is a growing concern, with personal data scams and other such issues on the rise. I think we are resigned to the fact that our data is being harvested regardless, so transparency is appreciated!"
"It is always prudent to keep personal data confidential and good practice to get approval where needed. Transparency and trust is crucial to everyone and once lost, it is gone forever.Therefore when developing customer feedback system, brands must ensure that they respect the privacy of the customers and not let it be used for other marketing purposes."
"I feel a large part depends on transparency regarding personal data handling practiceas, since by having the proper practices,  customer will be able to trust the brand, hence increasing brand perception."
"Significantly now, as customers demand transparency on where and how their data is used and handled"
Transparency on personal data handling practices do not greatly affect brand perceptions as long as key financial data such as credit card and phone numbers are not compromised (e.g do not sell my email/phone number to external parties) 
Very little 
Very highly. Not helpful if there is no info on how customers are protected and standards brand is adhering to.
It does not matter much as there is a high level of distrust between personal data handling at a brand level. Only when it is at a country or region level (like EU) where enforcement can be carried out will it make a difference
Depends on the market. I don't think Asians are as sensitive to data handling as Europeans or Americans are
"Brand perception does drop when there is a data leak from their database; hence, I would think that the protection of personal data is crucial for brands to have a good perception."
"Yes, brands should be transparent in how my personal data is used. However, having lengthy terms and conditions may not work for me. They should have simple and accurate explanation how the data is used. Whether my information is passed to outsourced partners for marketing should be a red flag."
"Transparency is crucial, as customers increasingly expect clear information on what data is being collected and how it will be used. Brands should also provide options for users to anonymize their personal data or opt out of data collection, reinforcing trust and respecting user privacy."
