"Service quality is obvious and can be seen or felt by a customer. However, the service provider must be appropriately trained and be skilled in handling customer's expectations especially the difficult ones.

I would tend to be a return customer to a brand which responds to questions and feedback promptly and reliability. High service quality such as getting appropriate responses is a reasonable time frame would incentivise me to be a repeat customer. 
Good service quality increases customer trust and likelihood of long term brand loyalty 
"Even if brand considers itself “budget” and not full service, having good customer service quality is helpful in assuring that customers will not be left high and dry!"
"Personally, service quality is extremely important. Especially in customer service deficient countries like Singapore."

"Customers would prefer service quality that matches their expectations. With the matching of the customer's expectations, customers are more likely to stay loyal to the brand because they can trust what they are getting from the company.  "
"Creating a positive experience for the whole spectrum to payment and delivery is key factor. The End-to-End experience is important. No point having quality products, but delivery is problematic"
High quality service would gain higher trust and creates a positive experience amongst the users. This comes alongside with the product quality to build long-term brand loyalty.
