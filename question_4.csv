Q4: Are C driven towards big players and popular when choosing a product?
It has some influence in terms of brand name recognition and as a signifier of quality
"There are users who are FOMO but beyond that, brands would be wise to look at what others
 are doing right to be successful or popular. Success means bringing in revenues but popularity 
may not if the platform is not user friendly. Dependent on the type of AI platform, if brands are 
looking for viewership numbers, then popularity plays a part, but if it's a high end brand that only
 the rich and famous can afford, then popularity is not a gauge for success. "

Deeply important. Good experience drive repeat customers. Tough to say. Customers definitely rarely determine value from a prima facie assessment of the product. They more likely use proxies to determine this ie what friends or celebrities say or how veblen the “good” is perceived to be. Queues around it (which can be easily generated by controlling supply) etc. actually today's customers are more likely to try start up brands for the novelty rather than established brand names which can be considered old and passe. 
"Yes, the common perception is that big players have a reputation to protect, hence this gives customers the trust to buy products from the company. "
"Yes, very much because of quality assurance, stronger security of online purchases and modes of online payment and assurance of delivery. Also, you perceive that there is a proper refund and resolution process in place. "
Yes. Brand popularity is often highly sought after due to its reliability and quality products. This is especially so for long term users and even new customers as they would be attracted by the brand name and what it can offer in terms of credibility.
